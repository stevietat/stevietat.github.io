**UPDATE:** Ok so first let me just say wow, I never imagined this little diversionary graphic would get such a response. So to everyone who has commented, critiqued, sent emails, twittered, and generally spread it around I have to say THANK YOU! So I've also had a couple requests about posters and print outs, so I've gone ahead and put it for [sale here on Zazzle.](http://www.zazzle.com/stevietat*) It's pretty flexible in that it allows you to decide what size and quality print you want. So thanks again to everyone for giving Megashark such love, and I'll let you get on to the original post:

Last year, I discovered the wonderfully cheezy and sharky movie: [Mega Shark Vs. Giant Octopus](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1350498/). While it certainly appealed to a more straight-to-DVD niche market of creature-feature enthusiasts, it wasn't half bad. Pretty laughable in parts...well actually, in most parts when you consider the wooden acting and crap computer animation. However the most ridiculous scene has to be when Mega Shark takes down a commercial jetliner that is cruising over the middle of the ocean. It was this moment that took the movie from being a little ho-hum to "holy shit, did that shark just eat a plane!?". Check out the clip for yourself on youtube [here](http://www.youtube.com/v/I16_8l0yS-g&amp;hl=en_US&amp;fs=1&amp;).<!--more-->

It's pretty incredible when you think about it. I mean, how the hell did it do that? What would it require for a shark the size of a plane to launch itself out of the water and take down a moving aircraft? After reviewing some of my basic physics calculations (thanks SUVAT!) I came up with some pretty startling figures. However, it didn't feel like I would be doing such an epic event justice with just a basic blog post, which meant it was time to do what I love most: an infographic! I had been itching to do one for a while now, and this seemed like the perfect opportunity. So with all that said, check out the resulting design below. Oh, and just click on the image to download the full size PDF version for the smaller details.

It's been a while since any sort of update, and while I'll hopefully have one last infographic done before the year is out, I do have a fun little holiday card to share. This all actually started at my company's [United Way](http://www.unitedway.ca/ ) auction, where my services were put up for sale to design the bidder's holiday card. Lucky for me it was [Ashley](http://twitter.com/#!/Lozlania) from account services, who already having seen some of my previous infographic work wanted to something similarly fun and quirky. After a brainstorm session, we came up with some ideas around how having an Abominable Snowman around for the holidays would be amazing.<!--more-->

Thus I went off and did my thing to come up with the following. It's a little on the cutesy, almost kids-storybook side of things, which felt more appropriate for something that would be mass mailed to all sorts of people. As per usual click the image to get the full large version, also so you can download your own paper cutout snowman at the end.

With all that said, hope everyone has a happy and safe holiday season!

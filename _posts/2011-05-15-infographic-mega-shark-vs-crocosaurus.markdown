### It's been a long time coming. Seriously. I started this infographic about 2 months ago, but then work got in the the way and well...refer to my previous post for thoughts on that. This week, I kicked my butt into gear and finally got it done.

Now [Mega Shark vs Crocosaurus](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1705773/) definitely does not surpass its predecessor Mega Shark vs Giant Octopus because well, in my opinion, Crocosaurus was pretty lame. While Mega Shark was out there chowing down on an entire navy fleet, Crocosaurus was mostly just stressing about her eggs. Thus I wanted to put most of the focus for this on Mega Shark.

A key moment during the film is when Mega Shark eats a nuclear sub, which gives way to one of the better quotes in the movie: "The shark just went nuclear". For a while I planned for this to be the climax event of the graphic, but after some research, I discovered that when it comes to pure destructive force, it is actually the volcanic eruption at the end that trumps any sort of nuclear threat.<!--more-->

Now I must admit, the ending in my poster differs a little from that in the movie. Whereas the movie finishes with the two mortal enemies floating down to the depths, encrusted in cooled magma, I have Crocosaurus lose and Mega Shark decidedly win. I find that most of the "creature versus creature" movies cop out at the end, usually with the beasts killing each other or disappearing. But anyone who actually watched the movie knows Mega Shark would have completely spanked the shit out of Crocosaurus all the way from Panama to Hawaii.

So that's pretty much it. The finished piece ended up being a documentation of Mega Shark's path of destruction as he made his way from the Atlantic to Hawaii. Recently I've been loving more classic typefaces like Bodoni which is featured here, because it just looks so damn nice when set in simple black on white. It was also a fun challenge to work in just black or white with absolutely no colour, and I think the result is quite elegant.

As per usual, make sure to click on the image to see the [larger version]({{site.url}}assets/megashark2-large.jpg) so you can properly read the details. Enjoy!

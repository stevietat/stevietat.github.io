So while recently I've done some more in-depth design for fun (megashark &amp; avp posters), something I've wanted to try doing is some more quick and dirty experiments. That is to say, taking a simple idea and creating something visual for it in about **2-3 hours max**. So needless to say things will be a little rough on the edges, and I have no doubt there will be some wonderful typos and horribly written copy, but bear with me.<!--more-->

For this first one, the idea actually stems from a term coined by my co-worker who like me, has often had problems with Photoshop crapping out all the time. Enter Crashtoshop. From my own experiences dealing with Crashtoshop, I started thinking about how the process of losing work done on a PSD takes you through an emotional ride very similar to the [KÃ¼bler-Ross model of grieving.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K%C3%BCbler-Ross_model) Now this whole process usually takes place over a matter of maybe 5-10 minutes, but it's pretty powerful nonetheless.

Anways, that's the idea, and here's what I came up within 2 hours tonight. Enjoy!

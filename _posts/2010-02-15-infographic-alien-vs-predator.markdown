Let me preface this whole post with a warning that I am a total Aliens fanboy. Loved all the movies (even resurrection), and mildly enjoyed the AVP ones as well. So with that being said, about a year or two ago when some co-workers and I were debating who would win in an Aliens vs Predator match-up, it was no surprise that I got got pretty involved--to the point where I grabbed some graph paper and started plotting out the rise and fall of both combatant's attack potentials.

Now even as an Aliens fan, I'll admit Predator is pretty badass. His gear is just too good, and if it came to a 1-on-1 duel in an empty room between the two, I'll give the win to Predator. For me, the Aliens' strength comes from their ability to rapidly reproduce. So while a Predator may be able to take down a single Alien pretty easily, it's a different story when he's facing 10 to 20 of them. That's why I think time is THE deciding factor for this grudge-match. If Predator finds the Alien before it has a chance to reproduce more soldiers, it's lights out for the Alien. But if the Alien has enough time to get a cycle of facehuggers and chestbursters going, the tables are quick to turn.<!--more-->

Anyways, so back to the chart I sketched. I've had it stuck on the wall at work for a while now, and thought it was due for a more fleshed out execution. Plus it's somewhat timely with the new AVP game coming out, so it seemed like a no-brainer to do this for my February infographic. You'll notice I haven't declared a specific winner or loser in the chart, and for good reason: There are so many variables, it really is impossible to declare a definitive victor.

So with all that said, hope you enjoy. Just click on the smaller image below to see the full chart in detail.

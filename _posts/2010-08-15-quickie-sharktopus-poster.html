<p>It goes without saying I'm pretty excited about the upcoming feature <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1619880/" target="_blank">Sharktopus.</a> While I'm sure I'll need to do some information visualization after it comes out, I thought it would be good to get another design quickie out my system and make a movie poster for it. Recently I've been checking out old japanese movie posters, and wanted to do something along those lines, just keeping everything minimalist. I think it sets a nice tone for how epic Sharktopus is going to be!<!--more--></p>
<p>From start to finish took just over an hour, so not too much spit and polish on it. However at least it's not too overworked, so there are benefits in trying to keep to a time limit.</p>

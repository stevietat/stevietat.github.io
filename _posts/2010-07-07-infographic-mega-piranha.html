<p>So yes, it's been a while.</p>
<p>But rather than listening to me serve up excuses, let's get down to what really matters, that namely being: <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1587807/" target="_blank">Mega Piranha</a>. Yet another gem from the guys over at <a href="http://www.theasylum.cc/" target="_blank">The Asylum</a>, this was essentially the sister movie to Mega Shark vs Giant octopus, starring Debbie Gibson's arch rival, <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0862992/" target="_blank">Tiffany</a>. The concept itself was pretty interesting. Scientists in South America genetically engineered piranha that would rapidly grow, thus providing food for impoverished nations. Now why these scientists decided to go with piranha, and not something more traditional like salmon or tuna isn't quite clear, but as a graphic designer who am I to argue with geneticists?<!--more--></p>
<p>Predictably, the piranha get a little out of control because as with most genetically engineered animals, there were a couple side effects. Like the fact that they become hyper aggressive, are immune to bullets and nuclear missiles, and double in size every 36 hours. It's really that last part that puts these guys over the edge, because now we're in the realm of exponential growth. Which means it only takes 9 days for one to go from your average sized fish to the biggest freakin' animal in the history of EVER. Which is great if you need thousands of tons of fish to feed people with, but not so great if they escape into the ocean and head up to Florida to lay the smack down.</p>
<p>So of course there needed to be an infographic. While I focused mainly on the crazy growth rate, there were several other key points that needed to be illustrated. <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doeurIuvFGQ&amp;feature=related" target="_blank">This scene</a> in particular needed to be documented, and I almost feel like there should be a separate infographic dedicated solely on how to bicycle kick a piranha. But for now we'll make do with this one. I may have went a little overly tropical with the colours this time, but hey it's summer! And as usual click on the image to see the bigger version for all the details.</p>
<p>And all jokes aside, the movie is definitely worth a watch. At least check out <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pFhSogGnu4I" target="_blank">the trailer</a></p>
